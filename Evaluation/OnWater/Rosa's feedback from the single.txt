Rosa's feedback from the single 

What are your thoughts about the system?
Really cool, it could be super useful in dark or foggy Ely mornings.

Would you use the system? 
Yes! It is tricky to set up though. And large.

What would you do to improve the system?
Include a way to turn off the buzzer, I can see it getting really annoying for people and there are limits on when you can make noise on the Cam. We already have an egregious number of things to put on the boat, so it would be really good if you set it up to be a stroke coach. Like an all in one solution? Also could you make it float? 

Any further comments?
Its awesome :)
