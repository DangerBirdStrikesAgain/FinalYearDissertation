\chapter*{Declaration of Originality}

I, Alexandra Riddell-Webster of Murray Edwards College, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer Science Tripos, hereby declare that this dissertation and the work described in it are my own work, unaided except as may be specified below, and that the dissertation does not contain material that has already been used to any substantial extent for a comparable purpose. \\ \\
I am content for my dissertation to be made available to the students and staff of the
University. \\

%%% INTRODUCTION %%%
\newchapter{1}{Introduction}
First paragraph -- what the project is about and how you've done it. Clear statement of the project The conclusion and evaluation elaborates on how well you've done this. 
``Start the story''. The output of the project is a two page document for what people need to do to build this thing. 

\section{Motivation}	
Collisions are bad
Often coxes have items in their blind spots or coxless boats do not seen an obstacle as the rowers are facing the wrong way.
Good friend's concussion from collision between single and eight and resulting two years of intermission (can I name Kate?)
Other collisions -- see photos
Why have you done this in the technical way that you have?
Open source (add how to doc in appendix?) as previous solutions to this problem (see rowcus in related work) have proven to not be financially viable

\section{Related Work}	
Frame the project here - rowcus 
Epidemic and similar papers (reference the phrase `anti-entropy' from here and that you will use it
Rowcus 

\section{Starting Point}	
My work with hardware is pretty minimal, with some tinkering outside of class
Previous experience using Raspberry Pi single-board computers with AdaFruit boards
No previous experience with microcontrollers. 
I attempted get to know the microcontroller in the summer holiday, completing basic tasks such as flashing the onboard and offboard LED. I learnt more about MicroPython 
In hindsight, should have worked in CircuitPython
In networking, I have a little experience with networking and routing protocols. My experience is limited to the Part IB networking module (throughout the course of this project I took the Part II principles of communications course
The adafruit chips have open source CircuitPython libraries associated with them. While the GPS library was very much plug and play, I found deficiencies in the RFM69 library, which I fixed along the way, and have since submitted this as a pull request to the github repos

\section{Structure of the Project}	
Agile? Software methodology
Largely followed timetable laid out in October (see appendix)
Research -- which protocol to choose
How to use the microcontroller and boards
Implemented the technical core of the project (routing) 
Tested this layer
Application layer
Evaluation
Write up
