\textbf{Title:} A MANET to Facilitate Collision Avoidance in Rowing Boats

\section*{Introduction}
My project will implement routing in a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET). \\ \\
Routing protocols find a path from a source to one or more destinations destination within the network. Different routing protocols optimise different parameters, and are better suited for different network topologies and applications \hyperref[routing]{[1]}. \\ \\
A MANET is characterised by wireless nodes, a frequently changing network topology and no reliance on pre-existing infrastructure. They are decentralised and therefore have no single point of failure \hyperref[manet]{[2]}. MANETs have a large range of uses, from the military \hyperref[jtrs]{[3]} to facilitate communication, to autonomous vehicles \hyperref[auto]{[4]} or disaster relief scenarios \hyperref[disaster]{[5]} to gather and move data across locations where previously existing infrastructure has been destroyed. \\ \\
My project wishes to use a MANET to share a set of locations throughout a set of rowing boats, in order to facilitate collision avoidance. Collisions in rowing can cause damage to both rowers and their equipment. This project's motivation is to avoid rowing boats colliding with each other and with other obstacles. A radar and AI based obstacle detection system exists \hyperref[rowcus]{[6]}. However, to the best of my knowledge, collision avoidance has not been attempted by networking boats together. My project will represent each boat as a node in a network. Each node will store a set of locations the user should be warned about; passing location data throughout the network will be the technical core of the project. \\ \\
My project will be implemented in hardware, in the real world. In general, networking protocols can be implemented in simulation or in hardware. Depending on the nature of the simulation environment, it might not be possible to use exactly the same code in the simulator as in the real hardware. Due to the time constraints on a Part II Project, I intend to implement my project only in hardware. \\ \\
As stated in the cover sheet, Human Participants will be used to help test and evaluate the project. This will comprise a few volunteers to row boats, allowing the network to be run on the water. These volunteers will all be members of Cambridge University Boat Club, able to safely row a boat and navigate the river where the network is being tested.


\section*{Structure}
The first part of the project will be dedicated to research, looking at the Epidemic routing protocol. Epidemic was chosen as it is a delay tolerant routing protocol, and best fits the likely topology of networks generated by rowing boats. There is a high chance of partitions in these networks. However, the nodes in the networks will be highly mobile, meaning that data can still be transferred through the network through exploiting this mobility. A potential topology for the network, generated from looking at satellite images of a 5.5km stretch of the river Thames \hyperref[googlemaps]{[7]}, is shown in Figures 1 and 2, both on a map and as an abstracted topology. \\ \\

The first research phase will also decide on any changes that need to be made to the routing protocol to make it better suit the application. Finally, the first research phase will refine the evaluation metrics needed for the project. \\ \\
The second research phase will look at microcontrollers, particularly the Raspberry Pi Pico. It will also consider multi-threading on the Pico and in CircuitPython and how this can be exploited to most effectively implement my Part II project. \\ \\
After the research phases, I will implement point to point communication between two neighbouring (in radio connection range) nodes in hardware. \\ \\
The next part of the project will implement broadcast and controlled flooding routing between at least three nodes. A packet format will be defined as part of this, as flooding will form the start of the Epidemic routing protocol.\\ \\
After a flooding protocol has been implemented, I will build on it to implement the Epidemic routing protocol. The code will be written in a two week block, then tested on hardware in a third week. \\ \\
The application layer will then be implemented. This will ensure that the information passed through the network can be used. The application layer should warn the user when they are approaching an obstacle, and allow the user to add obstacles, which are then passed to the routing layer to be propagated through the network. My project aims to keep the routing and application layers separate for ease of construction, testing and evaluation.\\ \\
The hardware will then be tested, tweaked and evaluated. Correctness will be evaluated first on land, likely in a field, where analysis of the network is easier and larger numbers of metrics can be examined than in the use environment. Performance will be evaluated in the use environment - on rowing boats on the water. I intend to evaluate the routing and application layers separately. Evaluation of the network will likely consider connected and partitioned instances of the network separately. Evaluation is likely to look at the time taken for the network state to be flooded through the nodes, and routing tables then updated, as well as a packet loss ratio \hyperref[itu]{[8]}. Further evaluation would conduct some case studies, tracking a packet through the network and ensuring no unnecessary latency is added. The power consumption of each node could also be measured, giving a proxy measure for the traffic passing through each node. Due to time constraints, I consider these further evaluations to be extensions.


\section*{Success criteria}
There are three success criteria I will hold for my project:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Controlled flood routing is implemented on the network
\item The Epidemic routing protocol is implemented on the network 
\item An application layer to demonstrate the utility of the network has been implemented
\item An evaluation of the performance of the network has been carried out
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Extensions}
The success of my project will be defined by completion of the core criteria listed above. If there is time, I have set further challenges:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Case studies on the path and timing of individual packets are performed
\item The network is further evaluated by examining the power consumption of individual nodes as a proxy metric for traffic passing through a node
\item The User Interface of the device is evaluated
\item The application layer is further enhanced, using heuristics and extra data such as angle of attack from GPS and combining sensor data
\item The routing layer is further enhanced by passing additional data, such as location awareness, to the routing protocol
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Plan of Work}

\section*{Starting Point} 
I have a little experience with networking and routing protocols. My experience is limited to the Part IB networking module, although it is being expanded by the Part II Principles of Communications module and my research. I will need to add to my knowledge of networking and routing protocols. \\ \\
I have previous experience using Raspberry Pi single-board computers with AdaFruit boards. I have no previous experience with microcontrollers. I will need to improve my knowledge of microcontrollers to complete this project, something I have set aside time for in my Plan of Work.


\section*{Resource Declaration}
I plan to use my laptop to implement, evaluate and write up the project. It has a comprehensive system of backups through OneDrive and disk images. A backup of the project will exist with Git version control, hosted on GitHub. My own hardware, including Raspberry Pi Picos, breadboards and AdaFruit radio and GPS modules will be used to develop and implement the project.\\ \\
Libraries to interface with the AdaFruit boards are written by AdaFruit in Circuit Python, and in my experience tend to be robust, although they occasionally contain bugs. If necessary, I can fork the code and implement bug fixes. \\ \\
My project will partially rely on the correctness of routing protocols, work that others have already published. \hyperref[epidemic]{[9]} \\ \\
As the project has a real-world implementation, I have permission from Cambridge University Boat Club to test devices on their boats.
